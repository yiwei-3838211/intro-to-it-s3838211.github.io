My name is yiwei lin, my student number is s3838211 and my student email is s3838211@student.rmit.edu.au, my home country is china, i was graduated from university high. I am interested in video game and kpop.

## Interest in IT

I was learning IT about year 11, i am interested in video game, so i wanna know more about computer or internet, actually when i really know it, i realized that not simple as i think before.

I chose RMIT because there is high employment rate and a lots of chance of internship in RMIT.

I expect i can learn enough skill to look for a fancy job in the huge internet company, such as apple, google.

## Ideal job

In this position need Analysis, design and development of software products and services.

It need Strong experience in java programming with the ability to do code level design 

This those several year in RMIT i will improve my java programming ability and learn how to work with others

## Personal profile
From Myers-Briggs test my personality type is: Defender ISFJ-T.
From study style test i am Reflector style.
From Interactive Leadership Style Assessment i am a Front-line Leader.

From those test my personality is easy going and humble although some weaknesses are Too Altruistic and Shy. 

At lease in a team, i may be a good colleagues, i have a spirit of friends helping friends to get the job done and i know how to be genuine and present during interpersonal interactions. And  i skilled at remembering things about others which makes them not only valuable assistants, but well-liked colleagues.

When i forming a team. I suppose can work with any kind of teammates.

## Project Idea
Practical application of computer energy saving and consumption reduction

### overview
The scale of computer network, with the increase of business expansion, there are more and more computers, servers and network equipment to join the local area network, coupled with some bad habits, such as non-working hours still open equipment, bring about the continuous growth of power consumption, but also directly lead to the rise of electricity costs. But the power consumption of computer equipment can be controlled through the program to achieve energy saving, and can get a good effect.

### motivation
As ordinary computer users, we probably never think about the question of how long should we run the computer? because when we only had one computer, it wasn't a serious problem at all.But when we have tens of thousands of servers or more, power savings can be a big problem.

### description
Usually, the maximum power of the desktop power supply is 250-300W, desktop computer too much time in 75% ~ 85% of the load work, take the middle value calculation, desktop power consumption is about 220W. Then, calculated with 8 hours of working time every day, the power consumption of each computer is 0.22kWÃ—8h, equal to 1.76kWh per day. The annual working time is about 250 days, then the power consumption of a computer equipment every year is about 1 Day 1.76 kWh and 250 day 440kWh. the cost of electricity in Australia averaged $0.3025 per kWh for each computer used in 250 days, it cost 133 dollars per year. It's a lot of money and these expenses can be reduced completely.The principle of energy-saving program is mainly applied to computer terminals and servers to reduce energy consumption, and for other peripherals and network equipment, only to take the way to turn off the device, such as network equipment or printer when not in use, turn off its power. At present, the main way to realize the energy-saving software is to reduce the main frequency and voltage of the CPU when it is under full load, so as to reduce its power consumption.The second is to use the same way to reduce the working frequency of graphics card and hard disk; And computer idle turn off CD-ROM drive, USB interface, display and other auxiliary power saving methods. It is worth noting that the most important and basic standard of energy-saving software is that it can not affect the normal operation of the system. When the computer needs to be restored from the energy-saving state to the high frequency state, it should be able to immediately restore the high load running state. At the same time, the energy-saving program itself should be low load.More exciting.
### Skill required
I need improve my skill of Assembly Language and c language to write a program to monitor hardware power consumption.

### outcome
Through the use of energy saving and consumption reduction program, the power consumption of the equipment is reduced, and the "fatigue" working state of the computer is also reduced, and the service life of the computer is prolonged. For larger company or enterprises, energy-saving effect is more obvious.
